<h1>Google Vision Detective</h1>

A wrapper for Google Vision API. It eases all the preparations that needs to be done prior to sending a request to Google Vision API, which is image downloading (if it is taken from certain URL) and base64 encoding, API parameters preparation, credentials file invocation, etc.<br /><br />

It can be used as python package and CLI (command line interface). CLI is rather for demonstration purposes.<br /><br />

<h3>Instalation</h3>

<p>Install using pip:</p>
```
pip install git+git://github.com/arrrlo/Google-Vision-Detective@master
```
